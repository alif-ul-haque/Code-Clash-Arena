# Pages - Homepage, Login & Signup

Main page components for the authentication and homepage module.

## Purpose

This directory contains the full page components that represent distinct routes/screens in the authentication flow:

## Pages

- **Homepage**: Landing page of the application
- **Login**: User login page
- **Signup**: User registration page

## Page Structure

Each page component should:
- Import necessary sub-components from the `components/` directory
- Import styling from the `style/` directory
- Use utilities from the `utilities/` directory for business logic
- Handle page-level state and routing

## Navigation

Pages are typically connected through React Router or similar routing mechanism in the main application.
