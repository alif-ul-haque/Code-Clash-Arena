# Components - Practice Gym

Reusable UI components for the practice gym module.

## Purpose

This directory contains modular, reusable React components that are used across the practice gym feature.

## Component Categories

- **Code Editor Components**: Code input, syntax highlighting, theme selector
- **Problem Components**: Problem statement, test cases, difficulty badge
- **Result Components**: Execution results, error messages, test output
- **Progress Components**: Stats display, achievement badges, progress bars
- **UI Components**: Buttons, modals, dropdowns, navigation

## Guidelines

- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use props for configuration and data passing
- Maintain consistent styling with the module's style guide
- Document component props and usage

## Examples

Each component should export a single default React component and can include prop types or TypeScript definitions.
