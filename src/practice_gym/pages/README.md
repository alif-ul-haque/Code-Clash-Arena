# Pages - Practice Gym

Main page components for the practice gym module.

## Purpose

This directory contains the full page components that represent distinct routes/screens in the practice gym:

## Pages

- **Problem Browser**: List and search practice problems
- **Practice Session**: Code editor with problem statement and test cases
- **Results Page**: Display execution results and feedback
- **Progress Dashboard**: View user statistics and achievements
- **Leaderboard**: Compare performance with other users

## Page Structure

Each page component should:
- Import necessary sub-components from the `components/` directory
- Import styling from the `style/` directory
- Use utilities from the `utilities/` directory for business logic
- Handle page-level state and routing

## Navigation

Pages are typically connected through React Router or similar routing mechanism in the main application.
